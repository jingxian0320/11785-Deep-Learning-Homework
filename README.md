Homework Repo for 11785 Deep Learning

* hw1p2 - [Frame Level Classification of Speech](https://www.kaggle.com/c/11-785-s20-hw1p2): The job is to identify the phoneme state label for each frame in the test data set (aligned). 
* hw2p2 - [Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/11-785-s20-hw2p2-classification): Given an image of a personâ€™s face, the task of classifying the ID of the face is known as face classification. 
* hw2p2 - [Verification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/11-785-s20-hw2p2-verification): The solution outputs a numeric score that quantifies how similar the faces in the two images are. 
* hw3p2 - [Deep Learning Transcript Generation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/11-785-s20-hw3p2): Predict the phonemes contained in utterances in the test set (unaligned). You are not given aligned phonemes in the training data, and you are not asked to produce alignment for the test data.
* hw4p2 - Attention-based End-to-End Speech-to-Text Deep Neural Network: End-to-end, the system is able to transcribe a given speech utterance to its corresponding transcript.

Also, the repo contains an implementation of mytorch from scratch which can be used to construct MLP, CNN, and RNN.
